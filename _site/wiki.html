<h2 id="head">BitTorrent in a sentence?</h2>
<p id="para">BitTorrent is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing ("P2P") which is used to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet.</p>
    
<h2 id="head">The brief answer</h2>
    <p id="para">The BitTorrent free to use protocol can be used to reduce the impact on the server distributing large files. Downloading a large file from one single source can be slow and to operate under many request the server needs more resources, instead the BitTorrent provides protocol which is based on principal called tit-for-tat, whihc means in order to receive files, you have to upload them to. This solves the problem of leeching, which was Bram Cohen's primary goals. Thus BitTorrents allows user to join a "swarm" of hosts to upload/download form each other simultaneously. BitTorrent minimizes the bandwidth usage which reduces internet traffic spikes over a particular area. <br><br>
    <img class="img-thumbnail"src="http://history-computer.com/Internet/images/bittorrent.jpg"><br><br>
    BitTorrent host can be created on a home computer on low bandwidth. A user who wants to upload a file can create a torrent descriptor. A torrent descriptor is a BitTorrent file which contains torrent information and tracker, the torrent file can be distributed over the internet over (web,email etc). The tracker keeps the record of users connected in the swarmm it helps the client software trade pieces of the file.<br><br>
    To make the file available the user itself have to host it throught BitTorrent acting as a seed. The torrent(torrent descriptor) file is divided into segments called as pieces. As a a peer receives a piece of file it becomes a source file for other peers. Each piece is protect under cryptographic hash(SHA-1) which ensures that any modification to any piece can be prevented. Pieces are downloaded non-squentially and are rearranged in the correct by BitTorrent client when the download gets complete.
    </p> 
    <h2 id="head">Statistics</h2>
    <p id="para">From a famous study about 62% of internet traffic is p2p related, in which 53% of all trafic is BitTorrent traffic. Below is list which shows the populartiy of BitTorrent. <em>thanks to Wikipedia for this sorted list</em>
        <br><br><b>Entertainment</b>
        <ul>
            <li>BitTorrent Inc. has obtained a number of licenses from Hollywood studios for distributing popular content from their websites.</li>
            <li>Sub Pop Records releases tracks and videos via BitTorrent Inc. to distribute its 1000+ albums. Babyshambles and The Libertines (both bands associated with Pete Doherty) have extensively used torrents to distribute hundreds of demos and live videos. US industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails frequently distributes albums via BitTorrent.</li>
            <li>Podcasting software is starting to integrate BitTorrent to help podcasters deal with the download demands of their MP3 "radio" programs. Specifically, Juice and Miro (formerly known as Democracy Player) support automatic processing of .torrent files from RSS feeds. Similarly, some BitTorrent clients, such as ÂµTorrent, are able to process web feeds and automatically download content found within them.</li>
            <li>DGM Live purchases are provided via BitTorrent.</li>
            <li>VODO, a service which distributes "free-to-share" movies and TV shows via BitTorrent.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br><b>Broadcasters</b>
        <ul>
            <li>In 2008, the CBC became the first public broadcaster in North America to make a full show (Canada's Next Great Prime Minister) available for download using BitTorrent.</li>
            <li>The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) has since March 2008 experimented with bittorrent distribution, available online. Only selected works in which NRK owns all royalties are published. Responses have been very positive, and NRK is planning to offer more content.</li>
            <li>The Dutch VPRO broadcasting organization released four documentaries in 2009 and 2010 under a Creative Commons license using the content distribution feature of the Mininova tracker.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br><b>Personal works</b>
        <ul>
            <li>The Amazon S3 "Simple Storage Service" is a scalable Internet-based storage service with a simple web service interface, equipped with built-in BitTorrent support.</li>
            <li>Blog Torrent offers a simplified BitTorrent tracker to enable bloggers and non-technical users to host a tracker on their site. Blog Torrent also allows visitors to download a "stub" loader, which acts as a BitTorrent client to download the desired file, allowing users without BitTorrent software to use the protocol. This is similar to the concept of a self-extracting archive.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br><b>Software</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Blizzard Entertainment uses BitTorrent (via a proprietary client called the "Blizzard Downloader", associated with the Blizzard "BattleNet" network) to distribute content and patches for Diablo III, StarCraft II and World of Warcraft, including the games themselves</li>
            <li>Wargaming uses BitTorrent in their popular titles World of Tanks, World of Warships and World of Warplanes to distribute game updates.</li>
            <li>CCP Games, maker of the space Simulation MMORPG Eve Online, has announced that a new launcher will be released that is based on BitTorrent.</li>
            <li>Many software games, especially those whose large size makes them difficult to host due to bandwidth limits, extremely frequent downloads, and unpredictable changes in network traffic, will distribute instead a specialized, stripped down bittorrent client with enough functionality to download the game from the other running clients and the primary server (which is maintained in case not enough peers are available).</li>
            <li>Many major open source and free software projects encourage BitTorrent as well as conventional downloads of their products (via HTTP, FTP etc.) to increase availability and to reduce load on their own servers, especially when dealing with larger files.</li>
        </ul> 
        <br><br><b>Government</b>
        <ul>
            <li>The UK government used BitTorrent to distribute details about how the tax money of UK citizens was spent.</li>
        </ul> 
        <br><br><b>Education</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Florida State University uses BitTorrent to distribute large scientific data sets to its researchers</li>
            <li>Many universities that have BOINC distributed computing projects have used the BitTorrent functionality of the client-server system to reduce the bandwidth costs of distributing the client-side applications used to process the scientific data.</li>
            <li>The developing Human Connectome Project uses BitTorrent to share their open dataset</li>
        </ul> 
        <br><br><b>Others</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Facebook uses BitTorrent to distribute updates to Facebook servers.</li>
            <li>Twitter uses BitTorrent to distribute updates to Twitter servers.</li>
            <li>The Internet Archive added BitTorrent to its file download options for over 1.3 million existing files, and all newly uploaded files, in August 2012.[60][61] This method is the fastest means of downloading media from the Archive</li>
        </ul>     
    </p>
<h2 id="head">Drawbacks</h2>
<p id="para">
    <b>Legal issues</b><br>
    The BitTorrent protocol is perfectly legal to use, but it is used for trafficking copyright infringing material. BitTorrent provides a low cost and effective way to share large files to mass. In the United States, more than 200,000 people have been sued for filesharing on BitTorrent since 2010. In 2011, 18.8% of North American internet traffic was used by peer-to-peer networks which equates to 132 billion music file transfers and 11 billion movie file transfers on the BitTorrent network. On 30 April 2012, the UK High Court ordered five ISPs to block BitTorrent search engine The Pirate Bay. <br><br>
    <b>Malware</b><br>
    Several studies on BitTorrent have indicated that there exist files, containing malware, available for download via BitTorrent. Due to SHA1 collison, an attacker can modify the execution path and alter the chunks which can effect the victim downloading throught the BitTorrent protocol.<br><br>
    <b>Security Issues</b><br>
    BitTorrent does not, on its own, offer its users anonymity nor security. It is possible to obtain the IP addresses of all current and possibly previous participants in a swarm from the tracker. This may expose users with insecure systems to attacks
